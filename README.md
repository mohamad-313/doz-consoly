# Cli tic-tac-toe

A CLI tic-tac-toe game.

This cli tic-tac-toe game is made with Python.

This of this game is that first you get a number between 1 and 9 from Player X. 

In fact, each coordinate number is one of the houses.

And if the number that the player entered was not between 1 and 9 or not digit or....

he asks the player to enter his number again. This also happens if the nut you insert is fill.
Then this case is repeated again. But with the opposite player.

That is, for example, if it was X's turn. Now it's O's turn. And the same thing is repeated until one of the players wins
